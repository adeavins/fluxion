This project aims to create an ODE/SDE integrator with the user interface close to mathematical notation, and minimal amount of boilerplate code.

The project is in the initial development stage, where the user interface is being shaped (primarily, by writing example scripts and making sure they execute). Tests are scarce to non-existent, and things change rapidly. When the code becomes relatively stable, the minor version will be bumped to ``1``. Currently, the patch version signifies the latest major API milestone reached.
